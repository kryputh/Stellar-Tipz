/**
 * Augments the polling-based `useTipNotifications` hook with a Stellar Horizon
 * SSE connection for near-real-time tip delivery.
 *
 * When SSE is available a persistent event stream is opened for
 * `creatorAddress`.  Each incoming Horizon operation event triggers an
 * immediate tip-check via the underlying `useTipNotifications` poll, so new
 * tips are surfaced as soon as they land on-chain rather than waiting for the
 * next scheduled poll interval.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff on disconnect.
 * - Pauses the SSE connection when the page is hidden (battery-aware) and
 *   resumes it when the page becomes visible again.
 * - Falls back transparently to the polling interval alone when SSE is
 *   unavailable in the current environment.
 *
 * @param creatorAddress - Stellar address of the creator to watch for tips.
